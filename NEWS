# sevenbridges 1.5.5

## Improvements

### API Client (Authentication)

- Support three authentication methods: direct authentication, via environment variables, or via user configuration file. Compliant with the new API client authentication specification. Please check the latest vignette `vignette("api", package = "sevenbridges")` for the current authentication methods.
- Updated platform types: now users can choose from `"cgc"`, `"aws-us"`, `"aws-eu"`, `"gcp"`, and `"cavatica"` in `Auth()` to avoid using API base URLs explicitly.
- Removed credential information parsing when package is loaded.

### API Client (Task and Upload)

- File ID support on task input (directly) ([#27](https://github.com/sbg/sevenbridges-r/issues/27))
- New argument `keep_test` for `task_add()` added: when users push a Tool object with no `sbg:job` information, can still use `keep_test = TRUE` to keep previous test information. ([#31](https://github.com/sbg/sevenbridges-r/issues/31))
- Support manifest file upload with fitler and subsetting for uploader ([#46](https://github.com/sbg/sevenbridges-r/issues/46))

### Docker Image

- Migrated Docker images to Seven Bridges Docker Hub account ([#43](https://github.com/sbg/sevenbridges-r/issues/43)), now users could use `docker pull sevenbridges/sevenbridges-r`

### CWL Support

- Improved robustness of `convert_app()` when a CWL JSON has more fields than defined ([#44](https://github.com/sbg/sevenbridges-r/issues/44))

### Miscellaneous

- New vignette style ([#38](https://github.com/sbg/sevenbridges-r/issues/38))
