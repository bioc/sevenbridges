### Features

- Complete API R client with user friendly API in object-oriented fashion with user friendly printing, support operation on users, billing, project, file, app, task etc, short example.

```r
## get project by pattern matching name
p = a$project("demo")
## get exact project by id
p = a$project(id = "tengfei/demo")
## detele files from a project
p$file("sample.tz")$delete()
## upload fies from a folder to a project with metadata
p$upload("folder_path", metadata = list(platform = "Illumina"))
```

- Task monitoring hook allow you to add hook function to task status when you monitor a task, for example, when task is finished sent you email or download all files.


```r
setTaskHook("completed", function(){
    tsk$download("~/Downloads")
})
tsk$monitor()
```

- Task batching by item and metadata

```r
## batch by items
(tsk <- p$task_add(name = "RNA DE report new batch 2", 
                   description = "RNA DE analysis report", 
                   app = rna.app$id,
                   batch = batch(input = "bamfiles"),
                   inputs = list(bamfiles = bamfiles.in, 
                                 design = design.in,
                                 gtffile = gtf.in)))

## batch by metadata, input files has to have metadata fields specified
(tsk <- p$task_add(name = "RNA DE report new batch 3", 
                   description = "RNA DE analysis report", 
                   app = rna.app$id,
                   batch = batch(input = "fastq", 
                                 c("metadata.sample_id", 
                                 "metadata.library_id")),
                   inputs = list(bamfiles = bamfiles.in, 
                                 design = design.in,
                                 gtffile = gtf.in)))
```


- Cross platform support from Seven
  Bridges, such as [NCI Cancer genomics cloud](http://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/) or [Seven bridges](https://www.sbgenomics.com/) on google and
  AWS, you can use it.

- Authentification management for multiple platforms/users via config file.

```r
## standard 
a = Auth(token = "fake_token", url = "api_url")
## OR from config file, multiple platform/user support
a = Auth(username = "tengfei", platform = "cgc")
```

- CWL Tool interface, you can directly describe your tool in R, export to JSON/YAML, or add it to your online project. This package defines a complete set
of CWL object. So you can describe tools like this

```r
library(readr)
fd <- fileDef(name = "runif.R",
              content = read_file(fl))
rbx <- Tool(id = "runif", 
            label = "runif",
            hints = requirements(docker(pull = "rocker/r-base"), 
                                 cpu(1), mem(2000)),
            requirements = requirements(fd),
            baseCommand = "Rscript runif.R",
            stdout = "output.txt",
            inputs = list(input(id = "number",
                                type = "integer",
                                position = 1),
                          input(id = "min",
                                type = "float",
                                position = 2),
                          input(id = "max",
                                type = "float",
                                position = 3)),
            outputs = output(id = "random", glob = "output.txt")) 
## output cwl JSON            
rbx$toJSON(pretty = TRUE) 
## output cwl YAML
rbx$toYAML()
```

- Describe simple linear workflow by connect Tool objects like this

```r
tool1 %>>% tool2 %>>% tool3
```


### Installation

__[Recommended: Stable]__  For most users, I will recommend this installation, it's most stable. 

```r
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("sevenbridges")
```



__[Latest]__ you can always install the latest development version of the package from GitHub, it's always the most latest 
version, fresh new but not fully tested,  with all new features and hot fixes, before we push to any bioconductor branch (release/devel) 

```r
# install.packages("devtools") if devtools was not installed
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
library(devtools)
install_github("sbg/sevenbridges-r", build_vignettes=TRUE, 
  repos=BiocInstaller::biocinstallRepos(),
  dependencies=TRUE)
```

__If you have trouble with pandoc__,  set `build_vignettes = FALSE` to avoid vignettes build, 

__[Bioconductor: Devel]__ Install from bioconductor `devel` branch if you are developing tools in devel branch or if you are users who use devel version for R and Bioconductor. You need to install R-devel first, please follow the instruction ["Using the Devel Version of Bioconductor"](http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/useDevel/). After upgrade of R. This is kind of tricky and hard, if you just want to try latest feature, please install directly from github as next installation instructino.

```r
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
useDevel(devel = TRUE)
biocLite("sevenbridges")
```

To load the package in R, simply call

```r
library("sevenbridges")
```

### Launch Rstudio Server and Shiny Server with sevenbridges IDE docker container

```shell
docker run  -d -p 8787:8787 -p 3838:3838 tengfei/sevenbridges
```

check out the ip from docker machine if you are on mac os.

```bash
docker-machine ip default
```

In your browser, 

`http://<url>:8787/` for Rstudio

`http://<url>:3838/<username of rstudio>/app_dir` for Shiny server

For example, if 192.168.99.100 is what returned, visit `http://192.168.99.100:8787/` for Rstudio.

Note: for users of that Rstudio, just create `ShinyApps` folder under
your home folder, then put your apps under that folder, so you can
visit `http://<url>:3838/<username of rstudio>/<app name>` for your
shiny apps. For example 

In your Rstudio server launched from container, please run

```r
file.copy("/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/shiny/examples/01_hello/", "~/ShinyApps/", recursive = TRUE)
```

If you are login as username 'rstudio', then visit  `http://192.168.99.100:3838/rstudio/01_hello` you should be
able to see the hello example.





### Issue report

All feedback are welcomed! Please file bug/issue/request on the [issue page](https://github.com/sbg/sevenbridges-r/issues) here on github, we wil 
try to respond asap.

### Q&A

- __Q__: Does this package support older API which is not cwl compatible?<br />
  __A__: No it only supports API v2 +, for older version, please check [sbgr](https://github.com/road2stat/sbgr) package, but 
please note that the old API or project type will be deprecated. 

- __Q__: Which version of CWL (common worklfow language) supported now? <br />
  __A__: Draft 2, progress on draft 3.
  
- __Q__: Is there a python binding for the API? <br />
  __A__: Yes, official python client is [here](https://github.com/sbg/sevenbridges-python). And lots pyton recipes are now [here](https://github.com/sbg/okAPI)
  
- __Q__: Why I always get warning message when I use API R client?<br />
  __A__: It only exists in Rstudio, potentially a bug in Rstudio. To ignore it use `options(warn = -1)`
