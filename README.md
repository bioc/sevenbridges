## Tutorials

Tutorials are listed on  [bioconductor page](http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.3/bioc/html/sevenbridges.html)

```
browseVignettes("sevenbridges")
```


## Installation

The package is currently not available in the Bioconductor `release` branch yet until next Bioc release cycle, please switch to the `devel` branch by following code to install.

```
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
useDevel(devel = TRUE)
biocLite("sevenbridges")
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest development version of the package from GitHub too:

```
# install.packages("devtools") if devtools was not installed
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
##  useDevel() ## ignore the erro if you cannot use devel
## biocLite("BiocUpgrade") ## don't have to run
library(devtools)
install_github("tengfei/sevenbridges", build_vignettes=TRUE, 
  repos=BiocInstaller::biocinstallRepos(),
  dependencies=TRUE)
```

If you have trouble with pandoc, either instal it or set `build_vignettes = FALSE`, 

To load the package in R, simply call

```
library("sevenbridges")
```

## Launch Rstudio Server and Shiny Server with sevenbridges IDE docker container

```
docker run  -d -p 8787:8787 -p 3838:3838 tengfei/sevenbridges
```

check out the ip from docker machine if you are on mac os.

```
docker-machine ip default
```

In your browser, 

`http://<url>:8787/` for Rstudio

`http://<url>:3838/<username of rstudio>/app_dir` for Shiny server

For example, if 192.168.99.100 is what returned, visit `http://192.168.99.100:8787/` for Rstudio.

Note: for users of that Rstudio, just create `ShinyApps` folder under
your home folder, then put your apps under that folder, so you can
visit `http://<url>:3838/<username of rstudio>/<app name>` for your
shiny apps. For example 

In your Rstudio server launched from container, please run

```
file.copy("/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/shiny/examples/01_hello/", "~/ShinyApps/", recursive = TRUE)
```

If you are login as username 'rstudio', then visit  `http://192.168.99.100:3838/rstudio/01_hello` you should be
able to see the hello example.
